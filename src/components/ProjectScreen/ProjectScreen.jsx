        React.js. Redux is a predictable state container for
        JavaScript apps. (Not to be confused with a WordPress
        framework â€“ Redux Framework.) It helps you write applications
        that behave consistently, run in different environments
        (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of
        that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live
        code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.`}
